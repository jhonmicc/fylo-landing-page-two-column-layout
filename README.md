### What I learned

I learned before after pseudo-elements, css flex, a little about code responsive page.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me for some css tutorial from basic to advanced.
- (https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me for some error solution. I really liked this source and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.youtube.com) - This is an video tutorial which helped me finally understand flex especiall how to centering a box. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
